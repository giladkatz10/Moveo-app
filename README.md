# Moveo-app: Real-Time Coding Collaboration Platform

## Introduction

This web application facilitates real-time coding collaboration between mentors and students. 
The mentor can share code with the student and observe them as they write and modify it in real-time. 
The application consists of two primary pages: the Lobby page and the Code block page.

## Main technologies
- Express.js
- Node.js
- React
- MySQL
- Socket.io
- Bootstrap

## Deployment

The website is accessible at: https://cute-blini-5f16a4.netlify.app

The client is deployed on Netlify 

The server is deployed on Heroku

## Future improvements 
- Implement automatic real-time client count when clients join or leave the code block room. 
I have introduced a 'reset Clients' button to address potential coordination issues between the mentor/student features. 
This button allows users to reset the Clients count.
- Check the Solution Feature: Introduce the "Check the Solution" feature for mentors to assess and validate students' real-time solutions.
